 * It's a Structural pattern - Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without
 * altering its structure (operates at Object level, not at class level).
 *
 * Acts as a wrapper to existing class.
 *
 * This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality keeping
 * class methods signature intact.
