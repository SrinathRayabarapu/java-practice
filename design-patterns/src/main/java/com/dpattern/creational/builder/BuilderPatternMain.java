 * Creational design pattern -

 * Builder pattern aims to "Separate the construction of a complex object
 * from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations."
 * It is used to construct a complex object step by step and the final step will return the object.
 * The process of constructing an object should be generic so that it can be used to create different
 * representations of the same object.
